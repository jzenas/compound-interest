# compound-interest

This is an annual compound interest calculator that calculates your expected retirement savings by taking into account your current salary, predicted annual raises, percentage of income invested, age, and investment growth rates. This tool is meant to make it easier for people to understand how future income increases would impact their retirement funds.
